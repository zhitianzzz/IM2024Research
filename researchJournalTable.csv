Arcangel explores the potential and failures of old and new digital technologies, highlighting their obsolescence, humour, aesthetic attributes and, at times, eerie influence in contemporary life. Applying a semi-archeological methodology, his practice explores, encodes, and hacks the structural language of video games, software, social media and machine learning — treating them as subject matter and medium.

In this work, Cory Arcangel used the contents of his computer’s temporary storage (RAM) as raw material for a series of abstract, glitchy videos. Each day over the course of a month, he would employ a hack to open this normally unseen data in QuickTime, which translated it into frenetic patterns of blocks and digital static. The resulting videos are presented on a website with a handmade, “dirt style” aesthetic, featuring visual and navigation elements that were created with a clone of the 1980s graphics program MacPaint. A scribbled calendar of the month of January 2003 allows users to access the video generated on any given day. As an autobiographical portrait of the artist and a record of the artistic process, Data Diaries evokes the subjectivity of the computer user. By rendering the artist’s data illegible, it allows the desktop computer to remain a private world, but one that is inextricable from the technical logic of the machine.

American Artist is an interdisciplinary artist whose work considers Black labour and visibility, as well as anti-blackness within networked life and digital systems. Their work includes video, installation, new media, and writing, and their legal name change to American Artist serves as an ambivalent foundation for their practice.

He addresses socially relevant topics, including surveillance, data privacy and technology dependence, through his work by transferring the gaps, contradictions, and absurdities of our everyday digital lives to physical settings. The effect is twofold. The works create an at-times bizarre confrontation with our own ignorance of globally active platform capitalism, and they renegotiate network activities as political forms of participation on an analog level using the potential of public space. Bartholl thus initiates a performative process to catalyse a renewed understanding of individual action within a collective and self-determined network discourse. Conceptually and technically, he uses the same aesthetics, codes, and communication patterns that users are familiar with from YouTube, Instagram, and video games. A purposeful contextualisation employs the logic of the Internet while at the same time undermining it with individual strategies.

A number of the works also involve digital projections in which the screens are the ""mental projections"" of the figures, video inside-out; that is, the inner ""imaginary"" workings of these figures, and how people interact with them, control what is seen. He has been one of the first practitioners of interactive art and of algorithmic cinema. The conversations that these figures carry on are neither completely scripted nor are they random; rather, the software gives each a ""personality"", a vocabulary, associative habits, obsessions, and other peculiarities, which make their conversations quirky, surprising, and often hilarious.

Although they hear each other, nothing seems to penetrate or influence their ideas; no matter what the subject matter discussed, they eventually return to their own interests and fixed ideas.
The dialog is not pre-recorded, and is different each time someone visits it, generated in real time by a computer program. The conversations that these figures carry on are neither completely scripted, nor are they random; rather, the software gives each a ""personality"", a vocabulary, associative habits, obsessions, and other quirks of personality which allow them to behave as if in a scene of film, acting out their role over and over, but always changing.

The ""cognition"" of this figure is made visible in a projection - the ones who speak with it literally see both their own words as they are heard by this figure, and in the formulation of a reply, something of the head’s ""thought process"".

According to the artist, ""Since I began archiving my own spam in 1998, I have amassed a collection of more than 50,000 useless, often offensive messages. I now receive more spam in an hour than I received in a month in 1998, and at the current rate of increase, I expect to be receiving about a thousand a day by the end of 2006. While each individual spam message is essentially anonymous and impersonal, the aggregate functions as some kind of degraded, degenerate depiction of me, and thus these works are some species of self-portrait: the artist as a sex-obsessed, Viagra-craving, mortgage-hungry cretin who can’t spell. The prints in My Life in Spam consist of superimposed images of every spam message that I have received over a given period of time. Depending on the dates and the length of time represented in each print (usually a day, week, or month), the images range from faint lines of partially legible text to intricate washes of intense colour. If the volume of spam is low, the result is a kind of recombinant cutup of multiple sales pitches. As the rate of spam increases, the individual messages melt together into dense gradients of colour. Thus, each print functions as a visualisation but also as an attempt to transform an utterly debased form of communication into something attractive, even beautiful.""",https://digitalartarchive.siggraph.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2005_Hoberman_MyLifeInSpamOneWeekNovember1-301998.jpg,,"My Life In Spam One Week (November 1-30, 1998, 2005",,https://digitalartarchive.siggraph.org/artwork/perry-a-hoberman-my-life-in-spam-one-day-december-11-2002/,"Data, Language, Digital Culture, Human’s Life",

Taken was exhibited at the Witney Museum of American Art in New York in 2007. Another of his surveillance works, Watched and Measured (2000) was awarded the ï¬rst BAFTA award for interactive art from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2000. Other works engage in a critical examination of the differences between human and artiï¬cial intelligence. The Giver of Names (1991-) and n-cha(n)t (2001) are artiï¬cial subjective entities, provoked by objects or spoken words in their immediate environment to formulate sentences and speak them aloud.",https://cdn.fact.co.uk/uploads/images/_extraLargeNoCrop/DSC_0250.JPG?v=1696924973,,"The Giver of Names, 1990-",,http://www.davidrokeby.com/cv.html,"Existence, Language, Computer’s Life",
leftDoubleImage,,"David Rokeby, The Giver of Names, 1990-","The Giver of Names is quite simply, a computer system that gives objects names. The installation includes an empty pedestal, a video camera, a computer system and a small video projection. The camera observes the top of the pedestal. The installation space is full of ""stuff""... objects of many sorts. The gallery visitor can choose an object or set of objects from those in the space, or anything they might have with them, and place them on the pedestal. When an object is placed on the pedestal, the computer grabs an image. It then performs many levels of image processing (outline analysis, division into separate objects or parts, colour analysis, texture analysis, etc.) These processes are visible on the life-size video projection above the pedestal. In the projection, the objects make the transition from real to imaged to increasingly abstracted as the system tries to make sense of them. The results of the analytical processes are then 'radiated' through a metaphorically-linked associative database of known objects, ideas, sensations, etc. The words and ideas stimulated by the object(s) appear in the background of the computer screen, showing what could very loosely be described as a 'state of mind'. From the words and ideas that resonate most with the perceptions of the object, a phrase or sentence in correct English is constructed and then spoken aloud by the computer.",https://esse.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/93_DO05_LeBlanc_Rokeby_Giver_Of_Names3.jpg,https://agnes.queensu.ca/site/uploads/2017/09/4_2000_David-Rokeby-the-GON_22sep12_Litherland-7-1440x961.jpg,"The Giver of Names, 1990-",,http://www.davidrokeby.com/gon.html,"Existence, Language, Computer’s Life",
